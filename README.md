# What's orr-portal?

The ORR system is comprised of: a backend component, the `orr-ont` service;
and a front-end component, the `orr-portal` web application.

This is the repository for the `orr-portal` component.

For the backend component see [orr-ont](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-ont).


# Deployment

Integrated deployment artifacts are created as part of the `orr-ont` build process.
See [orr-ont/DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/mmisw/orr-ont/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT.md).

The `orr-portal` component can also be installed separately. Let us know if you are
encountering issues or missing information about how to accomplish this.
